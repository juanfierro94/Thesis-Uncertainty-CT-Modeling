# Thesis-Uncertainty-CT-Modeling

## Project Description:

This repository houses the code and resources for my thesis project focused on uncertainty estimation in computed tomography (CT) scan modeling using Bayesian and deterministic neural networks. The primary objective of this research endeavor is to explore and compare the effectiveness of Bayesian methodologies in quantifying uncertainty in CT scan analysis.

### Key Features:

- **Bayesian and Deterministic Neural Networks:** Implementation of neural network architectures for CT scan modeling.
- **Uncertainty Estimation:** Exploration of uncertainty estimation techniques to assess model confidence and reliability.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Comparative analysis of Bayesian and deterministic approaches in CT scan analysis.
- **Deep Learning Methodologies:** Integration of state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies for improved predictive performance.
- **Documentation and Code Samples:** Comprehensive documentation and code samples to facilitate understanding and reproducibility of experimental results.
